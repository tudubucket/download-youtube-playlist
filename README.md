#### reason i made this shit python file:
- i dont want to spend couple of years just only to download a playlist that have over 500 videos on y2mate
- some shit website (actually they're nice) won't download videos that have copyright, or they will load the playlist to first 200 videos only
- i want to listen to some music when my location encountered outage
- i want some cul logs while the code running ðŸ˜Ž



#### what this code have:
- 32769 variables
- download up to any number of videos in playlist, not limited
- very slow code, need commits to fix these shits if you can
- bad englist in readme

### 2. Download the playlist
#### Step-by-step guide:

1. Get the youtube playlist ID: 
`https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=abcdef`, the ID will be `abcdef`, for example

2. Open the python file, change the variable `playlist_id` in line 5 to your youtube playlist ID

3. Run the python file:
Open Terminal, type `python C:\path\to\file\download-youtube-playlist.py`

4. Waiting, 1 video about 2 minutes length will take about 3 - 5 seconds

5. Have fun with your playlist, the result will be inside the folder named `playlist-output-{playlist_id}`, right inside the path where you put the python file
